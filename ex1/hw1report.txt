line parsing assumptions:
    since in hebrew new lines does not start with capital letters,
        we identify line ending using line ending marks such as quetion and assertion marks, dots etc.,
        which are followed by a whitespace character, such as a whitespace, tab, new-line, etc.   ********* (roman, please abreviate \ comment)  *****

Tokenization assumptions:
    Since we assume the text to be in hebrew with English names to be used, at most,
    we didn't taken care of more complex english corner cases, such as commas to abreviate the
    concatenation of words such as 'do' and 'not'

    Quotations, sarcasm, etc - We regard the content of quotations, sarcasm, etc. as a token /
    set of tokens which are separate from the quotation marks themselves when the whole quotation
    is standing by its own.
    This includes the cases where a, for instance, a sarcastic adjective is prefixed with another letter, such as:
       ה הידיעה: ה"שמח"
    which in this case would also be separated to 'ה הידיעה', the quotation marks, and the sarcastic adjective-'שמח'.

    Phone numbers - we tokenize, for abreviation, only for domestic israeli phone numbers, in an international format
    (prefifxed by +972) or domestic. Both contains city/cell company code prefix before the 7 last digits.
    We verify the number of digits in the phone number, and assume country-code,
    city/cell-company code and last 7 digits, are separated with dashes.

    Time - we tokenize time in the format of single or double digits for hour and minutes, (we also permits seconds) -
    all separated with columns. We also permits the AM/PM indicator to be included as part of the token.
    We disregard timezone code indicator, as we don't have yet means for distinguishing it from any other word the
    time token may be followed with (such as the false token that would occure parsing: '(18:04AM in) the morning)

    Dates - for abreviation, we only tokenized numeric dates. All dates are assumed to be 1-2 digits for the day
    and month indicators, and 2/4 for the year. all indicators are assumed to be separated with dashed, dots or slashes.
    The year section may come in front or as last.

    Comma separated numbers, and/or decimal point

    Hebrew abreviations using quotations marks before the last letter - this is to support cases such as: תנ"ך

    Apostrophe as abreaviation or scpecial hebrew sound - this is to support cases such as: טל', ג'ורג', צ'אט

    Censorship - we chose a subset of special characters (@, # and *) to be used for censorship. For your consideration,
    in the document, the words compounding the original foul word were separated with a space,
    hense are considered to be 2 separate word - 's@#*' and 'it'

    All the rest of the special characters are separated from the text.
